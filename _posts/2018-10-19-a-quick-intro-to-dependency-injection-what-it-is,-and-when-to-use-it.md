title: A quick intro to Dependency Injection what it is, and when to use it
---

### Introduction

In software engineering, dependency injection is a technique whereby one object (or static method) supplies the dependencies of another object. A dependency is an object that can be used (a service).

That’s the Wikipedia definition but still, but it’s not particularly easy to understand. So let’s understand it better.

Before understanding what it means in programming, let’s first see what it means in general as it will help us understand the concept better.

Dependency or dependent means relying on something for support. Like if I say we are relying too much on mobile phones than it means we are dependent on them.

So before getting to dependency injections, first let’s understand what a dependency in programming means.

When class A uses some functionality of class B, then its said that class A has a dependency of class B.
